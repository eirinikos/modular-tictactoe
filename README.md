####Greetings!
This repo houses several stand-alone programs that are written in Ruby - mostly to solve various small programming challenges. It's also a collection of fun things I hope to return to again and again for pair programming nights around town.

####tictactoe.rb
Run `ruby tictactoe.rb` from your command line to enjoy a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Play against another human or play against the computer; play on a conventional 3x3 board or play on a 4x4 board. :)

####_codewars.rb
This contains most of my recent solutions for Codewars katas.
(My user profile is [here](http://www.codewars.com/users/eirinikos).)
Some of the solutions have been refactored (after examining other Codewars users' solutions); I've knowingly left some solutions as-is (i.e., written at a low-level).

####_project_euler.rb
This comprises my tiny collection of Project Euler solutions.

####number_guess.rb
Run `ruby number_guess.rb` to see what this one does (or, just read the comments).

####cracklepop.rb
Run `ruby cracklepop.rb` to see what this one does (or, just read the comments).
