####Greetings!
I've pushed these files to Github so that I can track my progress.

####_codewars.rb
This contains most of my recent solutions for Codewars katas.
(My user profile is [here](http://www.codewars.com/users/eirinikos).)
Some of the solutions have been refactored (after examining of other Codewars users' solutions); I've knowingly left some solutions as-is (i.e., written at a low-level).

####_project_euler.rb
This contains my tiny collection of Project Euler solutions.

####cracklepop.rb
Run `ruby cracklepop.rb` to see what this one does (or, just read the comments :).

####tictactoe.rb
Run `ruby tictactoe.rb` to enjoy a game of Tic Tac Toe.
