###Hello!
This repo was cloned from my [ruby-bites](https://github.com/eirinikos/ruby-bites) repo - it houses a refactoring (WIP) of a [tic-tac-toe game](https://github.com/eirinikos/ruby-bites/blob/master/tictactoe.rb) I made earlier this year. This program - comprising a single class of 200+ lines - is kinda overdue for a refactoring. I had been pushing commits to an isolated branch on the previous repo and eventually decided that the code belonged in its own home.

Sandi Metz's [*POODR*](http://www.poodr.com/) is guiding me during the refactoring process!
